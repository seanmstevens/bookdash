    "description": "From the author of the “powerful, fable-like work” Intimate Relations with Strangers(Publishers Weekly) comes a dark comedy about a teenage boy who takes mind control to the next level and weaves a web of chaos to get revenge. With a device that enables him to control the minds of other people, the teenage boy at the center of this novel has powers just short of godly, and he's not afraid to use them. Especially after opening his bedroom door one day to discover his grandmother having drunken sex with a black man—in his own bed. Driven over the edge by his family's actions, the teenager turns against his grandmother, his father, and his father's assistant, programming them to do his bidding or leaving holes in their memory. After taking revenge on his family, the teenager decides to pair together a couple named Felix and Cassiopeia, who must carry out their controller's increasingly erratic schemes. In their travels, Felix comes upon a store selling an unapologetically racist and sexist book called The Total Emasculation of the White Man—which sets him off on a new and even stranger quest. Meanwhile, only one person is aware of the teenager's role in the ongoing chaos…and he must act soon if the farce is ever to come to an end. Blending elements of fantasy, time travel, family drama, and comedy, The Total Emasculation of the White Manwill challenge your views of gender and race relations while entertaining you with a funny, provocative tale unlike anything you've read before.",

Galal Amin once again turns his attention to the shaping of Egyptian society and the Egyptian state in the half-century and more that has elapsed since the Nasserite revolution, this time focusing on the era of President Mubarak. As usual, he orders his chapters thematically, addressing such pressing issues as corruption, poverty, the plight of the middle class, and of course, the economy. Along the way, he directs his penetrating gaze toward the Mubarak regime's uneasy relationship with the relatively free press it has encouraged, the vexing issue of presidential succession, and Egypt's relations with the Arab world and the United States. Addressing such themes from the perspective of an active participant in Egyptian intellectual life throughout the era, Galal Amin portrays the Mubarak regime's stance in the domestic and international arenas as very much a product of history, which, while not exonerating the regime, certainly helps to explain it.",

    "title": "Beyond Representation",
    "author": "Geraldine Harris",
    "genre": "PERFORMING ARTS",
    "description": "Beyond representation poses the question as to whether over the last thirty years there have been signs of 'progress' or 'progressiveness' in the representation of 'marginalised' or subaltern identity categories within television drama in Britain and the US. In doing so it interrogates some of the key assumptions concerning the relationship between aesthetics and the politics of identity that have influenced and informed television drama criticism during this period. This book can function as a textbook because it provides students with a clear and coherent pathway through complex, wide-reaching and highly influential interdisciplinary terrain. Yet its rigorous and incisive re-evaluation of some of the key concepts that dominated academic thought in the twentieth century also make it of interest to scholars and specialists. Chapters examine ideas around politics and aesthetics emerging from Marxist-socialism and postmodernism, feminism and postmodern feminism, anti-racism and postcolonialism, queer theory and theories of globalisation, so as to evaluates their impact on television criticism and on television as an institution. These discussions are consolidated through case studies that offer analyses of a range of television drama texts including Big Women, Ally McBeal, Supply and Demand, The Bill, Second Generation, Star Trek (Enterprise), Queer as Folk, Metrosexuality and The Murder of Stephen Lawrence. This book is aimed at students and scholars of Television Drama, Media and Communication, Cultural Studies, Women's Studies and those concerned with questions of politics and aesthetics in other disciplines.",

Has the country made any progress toward market reforms? How have Russia and the West responded to the actions of Belarus? And what is the future likely to hold for its ten million citizens? The author's conclusions are optimistic. Belarus, he believes, will survive into the twenty-first century, but as a Eurasian rather than a European state.",

A highly volatile drama in blank verse, Hogan's Goat is set in a turn-of-the-century Brooklyn populated by Irish Catholic immigrants teeming with hopes of \"the American Dream.\" The current mayor Quinn has been caught in a scandal and the time is ripe for a reform ticket. Ambitious Matthew Stanton has his eye on the mayor's chair, idolized and encouraged by his wife Kathleen. Quinn uncovers a weakness in the upstart's past however: he has not yet married Kathleen in Church because he is still legally wed to Agnes Hogan. \"Aggie,\" Quinn's old love, now lay dying but once, as Stanton's mistress, had helped him to his first political success. When Quinn plays this hand, Stanton loses the race and blinded by rage, lashes out at Kathleen, bringing both to a tragic end. \"Has the rhythms of highly charged verse, verse with a sting in its tail.\" -New York Herald Tribune",

    "title": "Diagnosing Corruption in Ethiopia",
    "author": "Janelle Plummer",
    "genre": "Business & Economics",
    "description": "For decades, corruption in Ethiopia has only been discussed at the margins. Perhaps because many have not experienced corruption as a significant constraint to their lives and businesses, or perhaps because a culture of circumspection has dampened open dialogue, Ethiopia has neither seen the information flows nor the debate on corruption that most other countries have seen in recent years. This study attempts to fill this information gap. Conducted by the World Bank (with financial support from the UK, the Netherlands and Canada) in conjunction with the Federal Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission of Ethiopia (FEACC), the study is an independent overview of corruption. It attempts to map the nature of corruption in eight sectors in the country. The studies focuses on three key objectives: (i) to develop sector frameworks that enable mapping of the potential areas of corruption on a sector-by-sector basis; (ii) to map the different forms, and types of corrupt practices in the selected sectors; and (iii) to consider the higher risk areas and identify appropriate sector or cross cutting responses for Government and other stakeholders. The sectors covered are health, education, water, justice, construction, land, telecommunications and mining. In designing the methodologies for undertaking the diagnostics, the sector experts developed approaches that most suited the sector and stakeholder context. However, a number of universal principles have guided the approach. One commonality in the methodology has been the effort to tap into the perceptions and knowledge of all stakeholders, be they politicians, senior government officials, private sector businessmen, civil society advocates or consumers of services. The diagnostics strongly suggest that, in Ethiopia, corrupt practice in the delivery of basic services is comparatively limited and is potentially much lower than other low-income countries. When viewed together, the findings of the study point towards an emerging pattern in sector level corruption, with interesting variations in the levels of corruption across the sectors studied.",

    "description": "Religion, Politics and Cults in East Africa is the first major, original, and extensive research-based study of the apocalyptic and doomsday Catholic Marian Movement and its Benedictine monastic moral and religious practices, including vows of poverty, celibacy, obedience, daily contemplation in silence, and hard work. The Marian Movement is presented within the cultural, historical, political, and religious context of the East African Revival Movement, the Anglican Balokole Movement, Alice Lakwena’s Holy Spirit Movement, Joseph Kony’s Lord’s Resistance Army (LRA), and other religio-political liberation movements, including the Maji Maji, the Mau Mau, and Nyabingi Liberation Movement. The Marian Movement was locally known as «Abanyabugoto» and «The Movement for the Restoration of the Ten Commandments of God». It began in 1989 as a Catholic women’s Marian devotional and moral reformation movement, founded and headed by Keledonia Mwerinde. Faced with African cultural patriarchy and male-dominated Catholic Church hierarchy, Mwerinde recruited Joseph Kibwetere and the Rev. Fr. Dominic Kataribabo to serve as the public face of the Marian Movement. In response to Catholic hierarchy’s opposition and persecution, Fr. Kataribabo designed a theology of ritual sacrifice, atonement, and martyrdoms for the devout Marian Catholics, who were devotees of the Blessed Virgin Mary. He martyred the Marian devotees in March 2000, in order to transform them into Mary’s saints, and to liberate their souls and send them to heaven, where they would instantly attain eternal life, lasting peace, and happiness.",

However, the key question posed by this study is whether the theory that political stability fosters economic development is simply the wishful thinking of people who value both stability and growth or whether it is a delusion of those who believe that most developing countries may enjoy rapid growth if they are stable. The importance of this study is clear: South Sudan is confronted with enormous challenges of administrative, ethnic, political, and economic development. In light of this, the current study addresses the following issues: \"What is the impact of the political system in South Sudan on economic development? What is the impact of oil resources on sustainable development? What is the impact of the oil shutdown on political and economic stability, and what is the possibility of deficit financing? Is there any possibility for cooperation between Sudan and South Sudan?\" In this context, the major objective of this study is to analyze the political development of the country to verify that political stability fosters the achievement of economic and social development. It also seeks to analyze the political history of Sudan in general and South Sudan in particular, emphasizing the importance of political stability, among other considerations, as a precondition for socioeconomic development. Furthermore, other objectives of the study include suggestions on how political stability could be ensured in South Sudan and how good governance may promote political and economic stability.

    "title": "Jacques Lacan and Feminist Epistemology",
    "author": "Kirsten Campbell",
    "genre": "Social Science",
    "description": "This book outlines a compelling new agenda for feminist theories of identity and social relations. Using Lacanian psychoanalysis with feminist epistemology, the author sets out a groundbreaking psychoanalytic social theory. Campbell's work offers answers to the important contemporary question of how feminism can change the formation of gendered subjectivities and social relations. Drawing on the work of third wave feminists, the book shows how feminism can provide new political models of knowing and disrupt foundational ideas of sexual identity. Kirsten Campbell engages the reader with an original intepretation of Lacanian psychoanalysis and offers a compelling argument for a fresh commitment to the politics of feminism. Jacques Lacan and Feminist Epistemology will be essential reading for anyone with interests in gender studies, cultural studies, psychoanalytic studies or social and political theory.",

    "title": "War in the Blood",
    "author": "Chris Beyrer",
    "genre": "Health & Fitness",
    "description": "This engaging and vivid book investigates the course of the HIV epidemic in seven countries of South East Asia: Thailand, Burma, Cambodia, Laos, Malaysia, Vietnam and China’s Yunnan Province. Emphasising the impact of the cultural and political landscapes of these countries on the progress of the disease, the book is the product of both working and travelling in the area. Not merely a commentary on obfuscating government statistics, the author draws upon his encounters with people dealing with the effects of the epidemic and opponents of the regimes of the countries he describes. The epidemic is seen as being vitally linked to the general condition of human rights in the societies. In the first part of the book the author travels to each country in turn chronicling the different approaches adopted to the epidemic. The second part covers issues involving specific groups at risk - among other topics, women and contraception, prostitution and the traffic in women, HIV and the US military, the Heroin trade, gay sex workers, prisoners, and the work of local activists. The third part of the book looks at policy and the general effect of culture on public health care, stressing the need for local empowerment of populations, and in particular women, to effect social changes that would go hand in hand with improvements in the handling of the HIV epidemic. Both passionate and well-informed, this book is a labour of love that discusses the HIV epidemic while giving an intimate, and ultimately celebratory account of South East Asia and asserting the real possiblity for affirmative action.",

    "title": "Looking Back",
    "author": " Joan E. Williams",
    "genre": "Biographical fiction, English",
    "description": "At a time when there is the great debate in the USA about which countries interfere in other's democratic elections and a time of great turmoil in Venezuela, this is a most relevant and timely publication. For the current events in Venezuela, including the shortage of basic food, state sponsored terrorism, civil unrest, hyper-inflation etc. mirror conditions during the cold war era in the small nation state of Jamaica when they too experimented with socialism. It was during that period too that the Russian KGB, American CIA and Cuban DGI were all active on the ground trying to influence the outcome of their elections. At that time, the author Joan Williams and her entire family faced grave danger which forced her to have to temporarily send her children away, as she was determined that the socialist/communist threat which not only brought in its wake, many mass murders, numerous state organized massacres and even treason by a member of the then government which was at the time under the tutelage of foreign communist agencies, should not succeed in depriving her and her people of their freedoms. Williams who has visited Cuba four times since then, (the last being in 2014,) says she has no regrets about the activities she participated in and dangers she faced but remains sympathetic to the Cuban people who she reveals are deprived, browbeaten and hopeless, much as the Venezuelan people are becoming today. While the first part of this powerful memoir deals with the struggle to preserve their freedoms in Jamaica, Williams also shares with readers the devastating period she went through when she lost her only son. He was murdered when he was only 24 years old. He died when a vicious killer fired one bullet into his heart. Although this happened over two decades ago, in her book “Looking Back……,” she admits that it took her many years before she could even talk about the event without breaking down totally. In the chapter entitled “To Hell and Back” where she bares it all, she says in part “the worst part was the sleepless nights though, especially when I teetered on the verge of suicide. There was also the inability to eat for weeks on end as not only had my sense of taste gone, but it was as if no stomach existed at all. That is when I went through every event of my life trying to understand why such a terrible thing had happened to me, for I did think I was a good person and terrible tragedies should never happen to good people!” This gripping narrative by Williams takes readers through a roller coaster of various emotions including those which she had to confront when she looked back a few years ago and realized that all the evidence pointed to the possibility that her son was murdered, not by a “criminal” but by someone in the Jamaican police force in her country where the police are sworn to “To serve and protect”. She has provided a mountain of evidence to substantiate her claims. This strong lady has however been able to recover from all her tragedies and struggles and risen like a phoenix to say years later that she is now one of the happiest persons in the world! Certainly not because her son was murdered, for she quotes the late Rose Kennedy; “It has been said that time heals all wounds. I don't agree. The wounds remain. Time-the mind, protecting its sanity - covers them with some scar tissue and the pain lessens, but it is never gone” but because “I have come to realize that your success and happiness lies in you. Resolve to keep happy, and your joy and you shall form an invincible host against difficulties.” This is definitely a powerful and timely book not only for women but also persons interested in history, politics, sociology and personal triumphs.",

    "title": "Masculinities",
    "author": "R. W. Connell",
    "genre": "Body image",
    "description": "This is an exciting new edition of R. W. Connell's ground-breaking text, which has become a classic work on the nature and construction of masculine identity. Connell argues that there is not one masculinity, but many different masculinities, each associated with different positions of power. In a world gender order that continues to privilege men over women, but also raises difficult issues for men and boys, Connell's account is more pertinent than ever before. In a substantial new introduction and conclusion, Connell discusses the development of masculinity studies in the ten years since the book's initial publication. The book explores global gender relations, new theories, and practical uses of masculinity research. Looking to the future, a new concluding chapter addresses the politics of masculinities, and the implications of masculinity research for understanding current world issues. Against the backdrop of an increasingly divided world, dominated by neo-conservative politics, Connell's account highlights a series of compelling questions about the future of human society. This second edition of Connell's classic book will be essential reading for students taking courses on masculinities and gender studies, and will be of interest to students and scholars across the humanities and social sciences.",

    "title": "The Politics of Vaccination",
    "author": "Deborah Brunton",
    "genre": "History",
    "description": "The introduction of public vaccination was among the greatest of public health triumphs. By the end of the nineteenth century, legislation framed and implemented by medical experts in Britain's government brought smallpox under control for the first time. The Politics of Vaccination: Practice and Policy in England, Wales, Ireland, and Scotland, 1800-1874, by historian Deborah Brunton, reveals the conflict that accompanied this success, and highlights how power differentials among government officials, medical experts, and general practitioners influenced vaccination policy across Great Britain. Brunton challenges the assumption that expert supervision was crucial, showing instead that local organization was pivotal to successful public vaccination. Throughout Britain, ordinary practitioners -- eager to enhance their professional status -- demanded the right to shape and supervise public vaccination. But their achievement depended on wider political considerations, and varied from country to country. In England and Wales, for instance, practitioners were defeated by a new band of medical experts who had established a power base within government. In Scotland, medical professionals contrived to keep most vaccination within the private sector, but local enthusiasm ensured very high levels of participation. Public vaccination was most successful in Ireland, where practitioners had limited influence over dispensary provision and smallpox was nearly eradicated, if briefly, in the 1860s. In The Politics of Vaccination, Brunton demonstrates that public vaccination was not simply a medical matter: it was a divisive political issue, with outcomes strongly influenced by competing partisan interests. Deborah Brunton is senior lecturer in History of Medicine at the Open University.",
